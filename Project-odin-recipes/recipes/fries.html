    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Perfect French fries with our easy recipe you'll end up with lightly golden, crisp fries. They're great as a snack or side dish to a Friday night feast</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg Maris Piper or King Edward potatoes</li>
        <li>vegetable oil, for deep frying</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and cut into 1cm-thick batons. Put into a bowl of cold water and leave to soak for at least 2 hrs to remove the starch from the potatoes â€“ this will help them crisp while frying.</li>
        <li>Drain the potatoes well and pat dry with kitchen paper. Fill a deep pan no more than a third full with oil and heat to 140C, or until a cube of bread dropped in browns in 60 seconds. Fry the French fries in batches for 6 mins per batch until golden straw-coloured, cooked through and lightly crisp. Drain well on kitchen paper.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat up until the oil reaches 180C, or a cube of bread browns in 30 seconds. Fry the French fries again for 2-3 mins per batch until lightly golden and really crisp. Drain on kitchen paper and immediately season with sea salt.</li>
